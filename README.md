## Requirements

You'll need to have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed in your machine to run this project.

## Running locally

Clone this repository

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/scoorpionx/weavebio-code-challenge
  cd weavebio-code-challenge
```

Give permission to the build.sh file and run it.

```bash
  chmod +x build.sh
  ./build.sh
```

It will build all the images on the compose and run it.

Just like magic.
